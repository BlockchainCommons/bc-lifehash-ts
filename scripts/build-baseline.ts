  `# Frozen build of the previous surface

\`${short}-baseline.mjs\` is the self-contained ESM bundle of \`${pkg.name}\` built from
commit \`${commit}\`, the reference for the pixel wire. Its sibling
\`@blockchaincommons/*\` dependencies are INLINED from their own frozen bundles
(${inlined}), so this bundle keeps their earlier behaviour after they change.
\`${short}-baseline.d.mts\` is the public surface at that commit.

\`tests/differential.test.ts\` runs every corpus recipe through this bundle and
the working tree and asserts identical outcomes; it pins the sha256 below so
an accidental rebuild cannot turn the differential into a self-comparison.

Baseline commit: ${commit}
Baseline sha256: ${sha}
